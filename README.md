# Wingly Challenges

If you want to join the engineering team, you will most likely have to complete one of our code challenges:

## Guidelines

- Clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- Install your dependencies (composer install, npm install)
- Copy the .env.example to .env file 
- Setup your database
- Run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
- Do one commit per challenge 

## Pointers

Cover your code with tests so you don't break what you have already done.   
For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is clean, extensible and robust.

Please also note that:
- All prices are stored as integers (in cents). Do not forget to format them if needed.
- We don't expect you to be a top-notch designer, but we want to see how you would handle some styling of this app. Do not hesitate to take inspiration from Wingly or anywhere else!

This repo contains the basic setup for a Laravel & Inertia.js application. It uses Vue 3 for the frontend and Tailwind CSS for styling.   
There is some boilerplate code, to help you get started but feel free to tweak it as you see fit.
